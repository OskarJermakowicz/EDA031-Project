\section{System description}
The application is a simple implementation of a news system where newsgroups and articles are stored on a server which communicates with clients that connect to it. The client is a Command Line Interface where users can execute commands to receive, edit or delete data on the server.

The implementation is divided into three packages as can be seen in Figure 1 below; server, client and library.

The purpose of both the server and the client will be further explained in detail in section 1.1 and 1.2 of this report. The purpose of the library is to handle the interaction between the server and the client...

%% TODO %%
A detailed description of your system design, both for the server and the clients. Preferably
use UML diagrams to give an overview of the design. (It is not necessary that you list
attributes and methods in these diagrams.) You must also describe the classes, at least as
far as stating the responsibilities of each class.
Also give an overview of the dynamics of the server, i.e., trace an interaction between a
client and the server from the point that the server receives a command until it sends the
reply. UML sequence diagrams are good for this purpose.

\section{Conclusion}

%% TODO %%
Conclusions: requirements that you fulfill, problems that you havenâ€™t succeeded in solving,
etc. If you have found that the system ought to have more features you should elaborate on
this. Any suggestions for improvements to the project are also welcome.
